# 3RPS_BallOnPlate

[demo-video.webm](https://github.com/pumaka/3RPS_BallOnPlate/assets/20409181/059b1a9c-9f9c-42d1-96a6-e65335298a7a)

## Caution

This is a demo project. So there isn't a manual or description to help you with the process.

The platform was intentionally made wierd and squiggly for me to explore many aspects of control engineering.(Although I did not expect it to be this shitty)
Hence, the platform has great many points where it wiggles and is fragile. And, your control system would require great margin if you do not take in all that non-linear stuff into calculation.  

## Purpose

Basic platform for 3rps parallel manipulator, otherwise known as ball-on-plate. Which is a simpler version of [Stewart Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_platform)

This project was made to reduce some of the tedious works that people have to face when carrying out the project.
Anyone is free to exploit this project as much as one might want. but, please don't do anything with the video. 

## Requirements

Arduino Mega board, [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD) program, revolutional-prismatic-spherical joints, resistance based touchpad and etc.

17HS4023 stepper motor did not have enough torque to sustain the structure, so i would like to suggest ones with stronger torque, like MG996R.

enjoy!
